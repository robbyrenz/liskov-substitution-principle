# Liskov Substituition Principle

This repo holds the source code for my presentation about the Liskov
substitution principle, one of the SOLID principles.
It was created with the help of the amazing
Motion Canvas library ‚ù§Ô∏è  As well as lessons that I learned thanks to
Venkat Subramaniam ü•≥

## TODO

* [x] create a `palettes` file that will hold constants for your colors in
hex values, so that other classes can easily import them
* [x] rename the `example.tsx` file
* [x] insert a picture of Barbara Liskov
* [x] code in the animations of how a stack ~~and vector~~ works
  * [ ] ~~don't forget to mention the practical uses of the stack and vector
  data structures~~
* [x] show the consequences of using the `instanceOf` operator in order to get
around violating the LSP
* [x] show how we can use composition/delegation
